## Vehicular Localization (VLP) and Pose Estimation (VPE) Simulation

1. <ins>"vlpAlgoSim_2qrx.m"</ins>: This runs the proposed VLP-VPE algorithm on the data generated by "02_v2lcDataGen/v2lcDataGen.m". See the article or the code comments for further explanations. After the run completes, the simulator asks you if you want to save the output data and saves it as a "results/vlpAlgoRun_<>.mat" file. Later these results can be plotted with a custom MATLABÂ© script or with "vlpAlgoSim_plotResults.m".

2. <ins>"vlpAlgoSim_plotResults.m"</ins>: This plots the result figures used in the article. If you have a new vlpAlgoSim output saved under "results/" for the same simulations scenarios (e.g., a worse channel condition version of SM3 in the article), you can replace the filenames in this script and re-run to get your output. Note that each option (i.e., SoA Comparison, Platooning with SUMO, Collision Avoidance) specifically plots the figures in the article, so this will not really produce desirable results with completely custom trajectories, you can employ your own post-process/plot script for that.
